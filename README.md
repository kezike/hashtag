Hashtag
It is no secret that the tech industry is currently experiencing an extreme drought in diversity. We on the Hashtag team believe that a major cause for this reality is the access gap that exists between the youth of underrepresented backgrounds and opportunities in the innovation economy. To address this dire need, we have created a platform in which we connect high school and college students of underrepresented backgrounds with each other, so that they have an early window into the great opportunities that exist in this promising industry and hence avail themselves of the rewards that come with it; a piece of the pie so to speak.
